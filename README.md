# File Processing Exam â€• May 13th, 2023

This repository contains a file processing exam along with the solutions to the problems present in the exam.

The solutions are written in C++ and are fairly basic and do make use of C-style strings and legacy C functions along with C++ streams with the aim of providing a good intuition into many aspects of file/string processing.

Hope you like it, have a nice day!
